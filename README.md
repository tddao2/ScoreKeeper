# Score Keeper CodeAlong

A bit of practice using the DOM manipulation content. With event plus [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics), some basic [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) UI framework, all will be wraped together and make this pretty simple ping pong scorekeeping widgets so it does not have to be for ping pong.

It's very straightforward. Two player games, each player has a button player. And then you can select what you want to play up to and we can expand on options. For more details, let's clone my repository and play with it.
